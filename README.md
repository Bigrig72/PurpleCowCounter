# Purple Cow Counter
React app that uses a counter API to gather website visits

Steps to produce in local env:

1. Pull the code down using git or fork the solution

2. run npm install prior to running

# Things to add in the future
I would like to add a new card where you can type in an input field and receive the amount of hits. I would also like to create a list of different websites and how many vists per day they receive.
